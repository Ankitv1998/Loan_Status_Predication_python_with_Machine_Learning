which technology based on technology???  // Loan predication project
ans: python 4th generation[detail on python]
object oriented language ??
<technology>- 6 feature:- class, object, abstract, Encapsulation, inheritence, Polymorphism
define Class :- keyward, blueprint, declare on variable or method on user. 
class define:-???
method or function define?????(both python)
object define:-?? 
all datatype are derived on object.(array, struct, union etc)
abstraction:-Hiding of data.(need of data to the system:- eg:- mandatory form of admission form)
Encapsulation:Hiding of implementation. 2+2=4 (internal process)
Inheritence:- parent class/child class: inherit on parent to child but not data used in child -->parent.
polymorphism: more behaviour or 



1. ML(supervised learning)



software ENgineering part (read)

future of project:
New technology add(+cloud, in future:-add )


high level language [regression , decision tree, support vector Machine]
invention:- which people
platform dependent(any os to execute) ,open source[free cost, customize on code, ..define open source]
there are 2 module on python:- 
1. application 




regression: bies varience(over fitting, under fitting , general information)

polynomial regression:- overfitting- all point are covered on .
Linear regression:-

tkinter- Gui Library.

Digital logic design : M/F label encoder: mL / (sckit  learn) ka library [label encoding/ order encoding(user)]


Data visualization:- matplot, seaboarn [ use any one--seaborn [Matrix form:- ROw and column ]] matplot :- any data visualization 

Data cleaning:- 5 process- if table is null value include -1.By delete row and column- loss data <if 20% ismore than null value then delete row and column> known- percentage find-according row after column
2. where is null manually filled on data eg:-integer [0] and char[unknown]
3.mean mode and median find krna: mean sum of value<given>/total : given output [fill all place]
4.divide on class according mean.
5.sktlearn -imputer[library]



Read regression


Training data:- keggle dataset <training 75% and testing 25%>  4 part |  |  |  |  |
but traning data80% and testing 20% 5 part {| | | | | | }


dependent data<y axis>, independent data<x axis>
